# MiningUp! - A 2D C++/SFML Game

MiningUp! is a 2D game developed in the C++ programming language within the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) environment. The primary objective of this project was to serve as a practical canvas for learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, and it has effectively fulfilled its educational purpose.

## Features

The game incorporates various features that demonstrate the understanding and application of OOP principles:

- **Menu System**: MiningUp! includes a comprehensive menu system that allows players to navigate through different game options.
- **Game Saving**: The ability to save game progress ensures that players can continue their gameplay from where they left off.
- **Player Movement**: The game offers smooth player movement controls to navigate the game environment effectively.
- **Animations**: MiningUp! features animations to enhance the visual experience and make the gameplay more engaging.
- **Object Collision**: The implementation of object collision ensures realistic interactions between the player and the game elements.
- **Randomly Generated Tiles**: The game world is populated with dynamically generated tiles containing valuable resources like diamonds, iron, and stone.
- **Moving Objects**: MiningUp! includes moving objects that add an element of challenge and dynamism to the gameplay.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Place the necessary SFML .dll library files in the same folder as the source code.
2. Install SFML within your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as MS Visual Studio.

## Gameplay Overview

MiningUp! is a simple yet engaging game that was developed as part of a university project. The game is built entirely in C++ using the SFML library and MS Visual Studio. The objective of the game is to collect as many resources as possible while avoiding contact with the rising lava level, which leads to the player's defeat. After each game session, the scores are recorded and displayed in the game menu.

Key aspects of the gameplay include:

- **Object Collision**: Interactions between the player and various in-game objects are governed by collision mechanics.
- **Tile Destruction**: Players can destroy tiles as part of their strategy, contributing to the game's dynamics.
- **Basic Physics**: The game employs simple physics to create a more realistic gaming experience.
- **User Interface Elements**: The game features a range of UI elements, including main menu, score display, pause functionality, end-of-game screen, help menu, and the ability to save and load games (the game also performs automatic saves upon exit).

The graphical assets used in the game were created collaboratively on platforms like Pixilart and Photoshop. Despite potential limitations in artistic abilities and time constraints, efforts were made to create an immersive gaming atmosphere.

Please note that this README assumes a certain level of familiarity with C++ programming, SFML library usage, and basic game development concepts. If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the game, refer to the documentation of the respective tools and libraries for assistance.
